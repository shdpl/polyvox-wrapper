polyvox-wrapper
===============
C wrapper for polyvox library (http://www.volumesoffun.com/polyvox-about/).

I was going to use SWIG heavily and i really wanted to believe it's not that bad.
Well, now my opinion is that SWIG really - is bad... and wrappers are slow.

So, i decided to make wrappers myself. Here is a wrapper for PolyVox.

I should put it to github sooner, but i was going to test all of it before.
Of course i had no time to do that, so now wrapper is out of date and still not tested but i don't care anymore.
If i'll be using polyvox more, it will be updated for newer versions and finally tested.
